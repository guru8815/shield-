## üö® Critical Issues to Fix

1. **No Database Integration for Submissions**
   - Forms don't actually save to database
   - Media uploads are not processed
   - Posts use mock data instead of real data

2. **Missing Media Processing**
   - File uploads need backend storage (Supabase Storage)
   - No file validation or compression
   - No preview functionality

3. **Incomplete Data Flow**
   - Submission form doesn't connect to posts table
   - Admin dashboard needs real data testing
   - User creation flow needs profile setup

## üîß Immediate Action Items

1. **Integrate SubmissionForm with Database**
   - Connect form to posts table
   - Implement file upload to Supabase Storage
   - Add proper validation

2. **Test Admin Features with Real Users**
   - Create test users with different roles
   - Verify all admin actions work correctly
   - Test RLS policies thoroughly

3. **Implement Media Handling**
   - Set up Supabase Storage buckets
   - Add file upload processing
   - Implement media preview and display

4. **Add Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for auth flow
   - E2E tests for critical user journeys

## üìà Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Add automated testing framework** (Jest, React Testing Library)
2. **Implement proper error handling** throughout the app
3. **Add loading states** for better UX
4. **Create API documentation** for admin endpoints
5. **Add audit logging** for admin actions
6. **Implement rate limiting** for submissions
7. **Add email notifications** for admin actions
8. **Create backup and recovery procedures**
